 *
 * SDL_mixer is a library to make complicated audio processing tasks easier.
 *
 * It offers audio file decoding, mixing multiple sounds together, basic 3D
 * positional audio, and various audio effects.
 *
 * It can mix sound to multiple audio devices in real time, or generate mixed
 * audio data to a memory buffer for any other use. It can do both at the same
 * time!
 *
 * To use the library, first call MIX_Init(). Then create a mixer with
 * MIX_CreateMixerDevice() (or MIX_CreateMixer() to render to memory).
 *
 * Once you have a mixer, you can load sound data with MIX_LoadAudio(),
 * MIX_LoadAudio_IO(), or MIX_LoadAudioWithProperties(). Data gets loaded once
 * and can be played over and over.
 *
 * When loading audio, SDL_mixer can parse out several metadata tag formats,
 * such as ID3 and APE tags, and exposes this information through the
 * MIX_GetAudioProperties() function.
 *
 * To play audio, you create a track with MIX_CreateTrack(). You need one
 * track for each sound that will be played simultaneously; think of tracks as
 * individual sliders on a mixer board. You might have loaded hundreds of
 * audio files, but you probably only have a handful of tracks that you assign
 * those loaded files to when they are ready to play, and reuse those tracks
 * with different audio later. Tracks take their input from a MIX_Audio
 * (static data to be played multiple times) or an SDL_AudioStream (streaming
 * PCM audio the app supplies, possibly as needed). A third option is to
 * supply an SDL_IOStream, to load and decode on the fly, which might be more
 * efficient for background music that is only used once, etc.
 *
 * Assign input to a MIX_Track with MIX_SetTrackAudio(),
 * MIX_SetTrackAudioStream(), or MIX_SetTrackIOStream().
 *
 * Once a track has an input, start it playing with MIX_PlayTrack(). There are
 * many options to this function to dictate mixing features: looping, fades,
 * etc.
 *
 * Tracks can be tagged with arbitrary strings, like "music" or "ingame" or
 * "ui". These tags can be used to start, stop, and pause a selection of
 * tracks at the same moment.
 *
 * All significant portions of the mixing pipeline have callbacks, so that an
 * app can hook in to the appropriate locations to examine or modify audio
 * data as it passes through the mixer: a "raw" callback for raw PCM data
 * decoded from an audio file without any modifications, a "cooked" callback
 * for that same data after all transformations (fade, positioning, etc) have
 * been processed, a "stopped" callback for when the track finishes mixing, a
 * "postmix" callback for the final mixed audio about to be sent to the audio
 * hardware to play. Additionally, you can use MIX_Group objects to mix a
 * subset of playing tracks and access the data before it is mixed in with
 * other tracks. All of this is optional, but allows for powerful access and
 * control of the mixing process.
 *
 * SDL_mixer can also be used for decoding audio files without actually
 * rendering a mix. This is done with MIX_AudioDecoder. Even though SDL_mixer
 * handles decoding transparently when used as the audio engine for an app,
 * and probably won't need this interface in that normal scenario, this can be
 * useful when using a different audio library to access many file formats.
 *
 * This library offers several features on top of mixing sounds together: a
 * track can have its own gain, to adjust its volume, in addition to a master
 * gain applied as well. One can set the "frequency ratio" of a track or the
 * final mixed output, to speed it up or slow it down, which also adjusts its
 * pitch. A channel map can also be applied per-track, to change what speaker
 * a given channel of audio is output to.
 *
 * Almost all timing in SDL_mixer is in _sample frames_. Stereo PCM audio data
 * in Sint16 format takes 4 bytes per sample frame (2 bytes per sample times 2
 * channels), for example. This allows everything in SDL_mixer to run at
 * sample-perfect accuracy, and it lets it run without concern for wall clock
 * time--you can produce audio faster than real-time, if desired. The problem,
 * though, is different pieces of audio at different _sample rates_ will
 * produce a different number of sample frames for the same length of time. To
 * deal with this, conversion routines are offered: MIX_TrackMSToFrames(),
 * MIX_TrackFramesToMS(), etc. Functions that operate on multiple tracks at
 * once will deal with time in milliseconds, so it can do these conversions
 * internally; be sure to read the documentation for these small quirks!
 *
 * SDL_mixer offers basic positional audio: a simple 3D positioning API
 * through MIX_SetTrack3DPosition() and MIX_SetTrackStereo(). The former will
 * do simple distance attenuation and spatialization--on a stereo setup, you
 * will hear sounds move from left to right--and on a surround-sound
 * configuration, individual tracks can move around the user. The latter,
 * MIX_SetTrackStereo(), will force a sound to the Front Left and Front Right
 * speakers and let the app pan it left and right as desired. Either effect
 * can be useful for different situations. SDL_mixer is not meant to be a full
 * 3D audio engine, but rather Good Enough for many purposes; if something
 * more powerful in terms of 3D audio is needed, consider a proper 3D library
 * like OpenAL.

 * An opaque object that represents a mixer.
 *
 * The MIX_Mixer is the toplevel object for this library. To use SDL_mixer,
 * you must have at least one, but are allowed to have several. Each mixer is
 * responsible for generating a single output stream of mixed audio, usually
 * to an audio device for realtime playback.
 *
 * Mixers are either created to feed an audio device (through
 * MIX_CreateMixerDevice()), or to generate audio to a buffer in memory, where

 * An opaque object that represents audio data.
 *
 * Generally you load audio data (in whatever file format) into SDL_mixer with
 * MIX_LoadAudio() or one of its several variants, producing a MIX_Audio
 * object.
 *
 * A MIX_Audio represents static audio data; it could be background music, or
 * maybe a laser gun sound effect. It is loaded into RAM and can be played
 * multiple times, possibly on different tracks at the same time.
 *
 * Unlike most other objects, MIX_Audio objects can be shared between mixers.

 * have been mixed. For example, when a game is in some options menu, perhaps
 * adjusting game audio but not UI sounds could be useful.
 *
 * SDL_mixer allows you to assign several tracks to a group, and receive a

 * Load audio for playback from an SDL_IOStream.
 *
 * In normal usage, apps should load audio once, maybe at startup, then play
 * it multiple times.
 *
 * When loading audio, it will be cached fully in RAM in its original data
 * format. Each time it plays, the data will be decoded. For example, an MP3
 * will be stored in memory in MP3 format and be decompressed on the fly
 * during playback. This is a tradeoff between i/o overhead and memory usage.
 *
 * If `predecode` is true, the data will be decompressed during load and
 * stored as raw PCM data. This might dramatically increase loading time and
 * memory usage, but there will be no need to decompress data during playback.
 *
 * (One could also use MIX_SetTrackIOStream() to bypass loading the data into
 * RAM upfront at all, but this offers still different tradeoffs. The correct
 * approach depends on the app's needs and employing different approaches in
 * different situations can make sense.)
 *
 * MIX_Audio objects can be shared between mixers. This function takes a
 * MIX_Mixer, to imply this is the most likely place it will be used and
 * loading should try to match its audio format, but the resulting audio can
 * be used elsewhere. If `mixer` is nil, SDL_mixer will set reasonable
 * defaults.
 *
 * Once a MIX_Audio is created, it can be assigned to a MIX_Track with
 * MIX_SetTrackAudio(), or played without any management with MIX_PlayAudio().
 *
 * When done with a MIX_Audio, it can be freed with MIX_DestroyAudio().
 *
 * This function loads data from an SDL_IOStream. There is also a version that
 * loads from a path on the filesystem (MIX_LoadAudio()), and one that accepts
 * properties for ultimate control (MIX_LoadAudioWithProperties()).
 *
 * The SDL_IOStream provided must be able to seek, or loading will fail. If

{*
 * Load audio for playback from a memory buffer without making a copy.
 *
 * When loading audio through most other LoadAudio functions, the data will be
 * cached fully in RAM in its original data format, for decoding on-demand.
 * This function does most of the same work as those functions, but instead
 * uses a buffer of memory provided by the app that it does not make a copy
 * of.
 *
 * This buffer must live for the entire time the returned MIX_Audio lives, as
 * the mixer will access the buffer whenever it needs to mix more data.
 *
 * This function is meant to maximize efficiency: if the data is already in
 * memory and can remain there, don't copy it. This data can be in any
 * supported audio file format (WAV, MP3, etc); it will be decoded on the fly
 * while mixing. Unlike MIX_LoadAudio(), there is no `predecode` option
 * offered here, as this is meant to optimize for data that's already in
 * memory and intends to exist there for significant time; since predecoding
 * would only need the file format data once, upfront, one could simply wrap
 * it in SDL_CreateIOFromConstMem() and pass that to MIX_LoadAudio_IO().
 *
 * MIX_Audio objects can be shared between multiple mixers. The `mixer`
 * parameter just suggests the most likely mixer to use this audio, in case
 * some optimization might be applied, but this is not required, and a nil
 * mixer may be specified.
 *
 * If `free_when_done` is true, SDL_mixer will call `SDL_free(data)` when the
 * returned MIX_Audio is eventually destroyed. This can be useful when the
 * data is not static, but rather loaded elsewhere for this specific MIX_Audio
 * and simply wants to avoid the extra copy.
 *
 * As audio format information is obtained from the file format metadata, this
 * isn't useful for raw PCM data; in that case, use MIX_LoadRawAudioNoCopy()
 * instead, which offers an SDL_AudioSpec.
 *
 * Once a MIX_Audio is created, it can be assigned to a MIX_Track with
 * MIX_SetTrackAudio(), or played without any management with MIX_PlayAudio().

 *
 * These are the supported properties:
 *
 * - `MIX_PROP_AUDIO_LOAD_IOSTREAM_POINTER`: a Pointer to an SDL_IOStream to
 *   be used to load audio data. Required. This stream must be able to seek!
 * - `MIX_PROP_AUDIO_LOAD_CLOSEIO_BOOLEAN`: true if SDL_mixer should close the
 *   SDL_IOStream before returning (success or failure).
 * - `MIX_PROP_AUDIO_LOAD_PREDECODE_BOOLEAN`: true if SDL_mixer should fully
 *   decode and decompress the data before returning. Otherwise it will be
 *   stored in its original state and decompressed on demand.
 * - `MIX_PROP_AUDIO_LOAD_PREFERRED_MIXER_POINTER`: a Pointer to a MIX_Mixer,
 *   in case steps can be made to match its format when decoding. Optional.
 * - `MIX_PROP_AUDIO_LOAD_SKIP_METADATA_TAGS_BOOLEAN`: true to skip parsing
 *   metadata tags, like ID3 and APE tags. This can be used to speed up
 *   loading _if the data definitely doesn't have these tags_. Some decoders
 *   will fail if these tags are present when this property is true.
 * - `MIX_PROP_AUDIO_LOAD_IGNORE_LOOPS_BOOLEAN`: true to ignore metadata in
 *   the audio data specifying loop points. This will make a file decode from
 *   start to finish without looping, even if the file specified it should
 *   have. This audio can still be looped at playback time via MIX_Track loop
 *   settings, regardless of this setting. Default false.
 * - `MIX_PROP_AUDIO_DECODER_STRING`: the name of the decoder to use for this
 *   data. Optional. If not specified, SDL_mixer will examine the data and
 *   choose the best decoder. These names are the same returned from
 *   MIX_GetAudioDecoder().
 *

 *   (13)
 * - `MIX_PROP_METADATA_YEAR_NUMBER`: the year the audio was released (1991)
 * - `MIX_PROP_METADATA_DURATION_FRAMES_NUMBER`: The sample frames worth of

 *   position in the track. This will be treated as if the input reach EOF at
 *   this point in the audio file. If -1, mix all available audio without a
 *   limit. Default -1.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_MAX_MILLISECONDS_NUMBER`: The same as using the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_MAX_FRAME_NUMBER property, but the value is specified in
 *   milliseconds instead of sample frames. If both properties are specified,
 *   the sample frames value is favored. Default -1.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_FRAME_NUMBER`: Start mixing from this sample frame
 *   position in the track's input. A value <= 0 will begin from the start of
 *   the track's input. If the input is not seekable and this value is > 0,
 *   this function will report failure. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_MILLISECOND_NUMBER`: The same as using the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_FRAME_NUMBER property, but the value is specified in
 *   milliseconds instead of sample frames. If both properties are specified,
 *   the sample frames value is favored. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOP_START_FRAME_NUMBER`: If the track is looping, this is
 *   the sample frame position that the track will loop back to; this lets one
 *   play an intro at the start of a track on the first iteration, but have a
 *   loop point somewhere in the middle thereafter. A value <= 0 will begin
 *   the loop from the start of the track's input. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOP_START_MILLISECOND_NUMBER`: The same as using the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_LOOP_START_FRAME_NUMBER property, but the value is
 *   specified in milliseconds instead of sample frames. If both properties
 *   are specified, the sample frames value is favored. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_FADE_IN_FRAMES_NUMBER`: The number of sample frames over
 *   which to fade in the newly-started track. The track will begin mixing
 *   silence and reach full volume smoothly over this many sample frames. If
 *   the track loops before the fade-in is complete, it will continue to fade
 *   correctly from the loop point. A value <= 0 will disable fade-in, so the
 *   track starts mixing at full volume. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_FADE_IN_MILLISECONDS_NUMBER`: The same as using the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_FADE_IN_FRAMES_NUMBER property, but the value is specified
 *   in milliseconds instead of sample frames. If both properties are
 *   specified, the sample frames value is favored. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_FADE_IN_START_GAIN_FLOAT`: If fading in, start fading from
 *   this volume level. 0.0f is silence and 1.0f is full volume, every in
 *   between is a linear change in gain. The specified value will be clamped
 *   between 0.0f and 1.0f. Default 0.0f.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_APPEND_SILENCE_FRAMES_NUMBER`: At the end of mixing this
 *   track, after all loops are complete, append this many sample frames of
 *   silence as if it were part of the audio file. This allows for apps to
 *   implement effects in callbacks, like reverb, that need to generate
 *   samples past the end of the stream's audio, or perhaps introduce a delay
 *   before starting a new sound on the track without having to manage it
 *   directly. A value <= 0 generates no silence before stopping the track.
 *   Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_APPEND_SILENCE_MILLISECONDS_NUMBER`: The same as using the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_APPEND_SILENCE_FRAMES_NUMBER property, but the value is
 *   specified in milliseconds instead of sample frames. If both properties
 *   are specified, the sample frames value is favored. Default 0.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_HALT_WHEN_EXHAUSTED_BOOLEAN`: If true, when input is
 *   completely consumed for the track, the mixer will mark the track as
 *   stopped (and call any appropriate MIX_TrackStoppedCallback, etc); to play
 *   more, the track will need to be restarted. If false, the track will just
 *   not contribute to the mix, but it will not be marked as stopped. There
 *   may be clever logic tricks this exposes generally, but this property is
 *   specifically useful when the track's input is an SDL_AudioStream assigned
 *   via MIX_SetTrackAudioStream(). Setting this property to true can be
 *   useful when pushing a complete piece of audio to the stream that has a
 *   definite ending, as the track will operate like any other audio was
 *   applied. Setting to false means as new data is added to the stream, the
 *   mixer will start using it as soon as possible, which is useful when audio
 *   should play immediately as it drips in: new VoIP packets, etc. Note that
 *   in this situation, if the audio runs out when needed, there _will_ be
 *   gaps in the mixed output, so try to buffer enough data to avoid this when
 *   possible. Note that a track is not consider exhausted until all its loops
 *   and appended silence have been mixed (and also, that loops don't mean
 *   anything when the input is an AudioStream). Default true.
 * - `MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_ORDER_NUMBER`: This is a special-case property that
 *   most apps can ignore. For mod file formats, start mixing from a specific
 *   "order" index instead of the start of the file. A value < 0 will cause
 *   this property to be ignored. If the decoder doesn't support this
 *   property, it will also be ignored. If this property is _not_ ignored, the
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_FRAME_NUMBER and
 *   MIX_PROP_PLAY_START_MILLISECOND_NUMBER properties will be ignored
 *   instead. Default -1. Since SDL_mixer 3.2.2.

 *
 * An audiospec is provided. SDL_mixer always does its mixing work in 32-bit
 * float samples, even if the inputs or final output are not floating point.
 * As such, `spec->format` will always be `SDL_AUDIO_F32` and `pcm` hardcoded
 * to be a float Pointer.
 *

{ Audio generation without an audio device...  }
{*
 * Generate mixer output when not driving an audio device.
 *
 * SDL_mixer allows the creation of MIX_Mixer objects that are not connected
 * to an audio device, by calling MIX_CreateMixer() instead of
 * MIX_CreateMixerDevice(). Such mixers will not generate output until
 * explicitly requested through this function.
 *
 * The caller may request as much audio as desired, so long as `buflen` is a
 * multiple of the sample frame size specified when creating the mixer (for
 * example, if requesting stereo Sint16 audio, buflen must be a multiple of 4:
 * 2 bytes-per-channel times 2 channels).
 *
 * The mixer will mix as quickly as possible; since it works in sample frames
 * instead of time, it can potentially generate enormous amounts of audio in a
 * small amount of time.
 *
 * On success, this always fills `buffer` with `buflen` bytes of audio; if all
 * playing tracks finish mixing, it will fill the remaining buffer with
 * silence.
 *
 * Each call to this function will pick up where it left off, playing tracks
 * will continue to mix from the point the previous call completed, etc. The
 * mixer state can be changed between each call in any way desired: tracks can
 * be added, played, stopped, changed, removed, etc. Effectively this function
 * does the same thing SDL_mixer does internally when the audio device needs
 * more audio to play.
 *
 * This function can not be used with mixers from MIX_CreateMixerDevice();
 * those generate audio as needed internally.
 *
 * This function returns the number of _bytes_ of real audio mixed, which
 * might be less than `buflen`. While all `buflen` bytes of `buffer` will be
 * initialized, if available tracks to mix run out, the end of the buffer will
 * be initialized with silence; this silence will not be counted in the return
 * value, so the caller has the option to identify how much of the buffer has
 * legimitate contents vs appended silence. As such, any value >= 0 signifies
 * success. A return value of -1 means failure (out of memory, invalid
 * parameters, etc).
 *
 * \param mixer the mixer for which to generate more audio.
 * \param buffer a Pointer to a buffer to store audio in.
 * \param buflen the number of bytes to store in buffer.
 * \returns The number of bytes of mixed audio, discounting appended silence,
 *          on success, or -1 on failure; call SDL_GetError() for more
 *          information.
